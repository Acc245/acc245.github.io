          <h3>About Me</h3>


          <p>Hi! My Name is Alexia Casalins. I am a 22 year old studying journalism communications at the University of Miami. However, my passion for graphic design and social media marketing starts at a younger age. In highschool, I was a part of the yearbook club as a graphic designer and outreach. I was able to persue my passion further when i started at the University of Miami.</p>

          <p>Being a part of The student spiriting board on campus, category five, really pushed me further than anything I have done before. My graphics have been on hats, sweaters, t-shirts and screens all over campus and social media.</p>

          <p> So here I am today, on the brink of graduating and excited to see the life ahead of me. This is a collection of all my work over the past 5-6 years. I hope you enjoy!</p>

          <p>With much love,</p>
          <p class="signature">-Alexia c.</p>

          <h3>My Goals</h3>
          <p>My main goal is to show the world just how great it is through graphics. For example, when I create brand kits with logos and colors I think about how to put the company's best assest and their companies mission and goals. This allows me to take my graphics more seriously.</p>
