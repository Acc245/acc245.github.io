<h2> Step 1: The Scouting Process </h2>
  <p> This step is the best step. All the fun and none of the worry. Just be safe we don't want to turn our campus into Florida State University with the tallahasse plague. It's easy to attend a college frat party. No seriously. That is if you're a girl atleast. Let put this into laymens terms. Cavemen will always let a cavewoman in his cave. Cave they/thems will always let cave they/thems into their caves. I don't make the rules. The neanderthals did.</p>

  <p> With that being said get out there. The college experience does involve countless late nights. How you spend them is on you. This isn't a blog post on how to graduate with honors so I am not gonna sit here and drill late night studying into your head. Go out and live a little. You needs to put yourself in the game to score a couple touchdowns.</p>

<h2> Step 2: The Recruitments</h2>

  <p>Assuming you listened to my last advice about getting out there, you have met a couple of prospects. This is good. If you haven't, return to Step 1. Sorry not sorry.</p>

  <p> We are coming up on keeping all these people you have met into a little subconcious group. Name them what you will.For now have as many FRIENDLY encounters as you can. Check out the library. Hang out in a group of friends. You really want to see how they treat you and other people before you even give them any mroe thought.</p>

<h2> Step 3: The Tryouts</h2>
  <p>This is where things get a little more technical. You need to really analyze who you want to begin putting effort into. This is where my chart comes into play. Now my chart will be full of hypotheticals so keep that in mind.</p>
