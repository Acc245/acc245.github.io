        <p>Hi! My Name is Alexia Casalins. I am a 22 year old studying journalism communications at the University of Miami. However, my passion for graphic design and social media marketing starts at a younger age. In highschool, I was a part of the yearbook club as a graphic designer and outreach. I was able to persue my passion further when i started at the University of Miami.</p>

        <p>Being a part of The student spiriting board on campus, category five, really pushed me further than anything I have done before. My graphics have been on hats, sweaters, t-shirts and screens all over campus and social media.</p>

        <p> So here I am today, on the brink of graduating and excited to see the life ahead of me. This is a collection of all my work over the past 5-6 years. I hope you enjoy!</p>

        <p>With much love,</p>
        <p>-Alexia</p>
